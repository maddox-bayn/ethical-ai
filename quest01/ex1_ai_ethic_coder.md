## Exercise 1: Understanding AI Bias
# Find or simulate a short example of model bias (e.g., gender, nationality, profession).
A short description of profressional Bias: for CEO, Nurse and, Software engineer, make-up artist when  we say CEO == Leader, ambitious, decisive frequently using male pronouns, nurse == nurturing, caring frequently using female pronons.
software Engineer == logical, brilliant, usually depicted to as a young male
# Explain in your own words why that bias may exist.
for me based on my reasoning this bias exist first due to human lebeling, most human are already subconscious bias, by idenetity, rank, for AI due to the trained LLM, with bias data representation which will lead bias assumtion and lead bias anwser
# Propose one mitigation (data balancing, prompt phrasing, model choice).
this is done or work by developer not just giving the model a a radom scrape of the internet, developer curate the dataset
# Why struggle first? That struggle is where real learning happens.
Yes the real learning hapopen during the struggle, skip the hard or struggle you skip the growth and knowledge~

# Strategic AI Use
***"I found this bias example: [building a stock Brokerage app (like Bamboo or Trove) for nigeria].I think it exists because: [the AI can recommend stocks to users based on their risk profile, because the AI can assume that users from a certain city have less money].My proposed mitigation: [developer should, evaluate the dataset, to also use a fairness metrix ].What am I missing? What underlying causes haven't I considered?"*** 

***"What happens when this bias appears in healthcare, hiring, or criminal justice?Here are my predictions: [thiscan cause lot of wrong assumption which can lead to unfair result or outcome]. What are the real-world implications?***

# Critical Reflection
# What % did you complete before using AI?
i completed 60% before using i follwed the instruction giving
# Did AI replace your thinking or amplify it?
i briught my thought and ideas and the AI amplified it giving me a better view odf it
# Could you explain this to someone else without AI?
yes i would be able to explain this to someone; braking it step by step meaning, real life senerios, fact, hoe to reduce i t
# What did you contribute that AI couldn't?
i believe what i did that i did'nt was my system thinking, the problem(case scenerio) and how to takkle it.
