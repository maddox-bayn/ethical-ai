# THE PROMPT PISCINE/AI-ETHICS

# Project Overview
The AI-ETHICS  is an intensive Second phase at Learn2earn Acedemy designed to reframe the relationship between a developer and AI. rather than always Using a copy of AI generated code. the goal is to master the "Human-in-the-loop" workflow, System thinking and flow, ensuring that the developer remains primary architect of the logic while AI serves as acatalyst for deeper understanding.

# Objectives
understanding core ethical challenges in AI systems
Analze bias, privacy risk, and accountability gaps
Evaluate AI decision-making transparency
propose responsible system architectures
Design mitigation strategies for high-risk AI deployments

# Core Ethical Principles
# Faireness, Transparency, Accountability, Privacy, Safty Reliability

#  Key Ethical Risk Area
* Algorithmic Bias
* Data misuse
* SUrveillance overreach
* Autonomous decision errors
* Lack of human oversight
* Security vulnerabilities
* Power concerntration in AI control systems

# Ethical Risk mitigation model
1. Data Governmenace layer- Clean, diverse, and audited datasets
2. ALgorithm Oversight Layer- Bias testing and explanation checks 
3. Operational Monitoing Layer - Real-Time anomaly detection
4. Human-in-the loop Layer - Overide and review mechanisms
5. Failure& Fallback layer - safe degradation modes

# use cases Covered
Smart city system
AUtonomous vehicles
Healthcare AI diagnostics

# Learning Outcomes: What i Learned
By completing this AI-ETHICS i have gained technical prociency in the following areas:

1. Networking Strategy & Protocol Selection: ***contextual Logic:***there is no best protocol only the best protocol for a specific constriant. ***Trade-offs ANalysis:*** can justify the cost of latancy (in Reactive system) versus the cost of overhead (in proactive)

2. High-Mobility Management
